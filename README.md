# Absoluver Guide
![App Introduction](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/nkululekodotio-2b22e.appspot.com/o/absoluver%2FFolder.png?alt=media&token=96fdaf53-656b-4a45-9728-049ad4a0ce0c)

## How the application works

* First run the backend
* Then run the front end 
* Then you can input any linear expression the application will solve.

There is a README files inside the backend and frontend directory on how to run the applcations

## Testing
For testing all the necessary files are in the tests folder and README file is included to show how to test the application using unit test and integration test.

## Implementation and Solution Strategy

* The application takes a a linear equation and splits it into tokens taken from the Machine Learning concept "Tokenization"
* When the string equation is into tokens it is easy to manipulate and classify.
* There several methods that are responsible for performing mathematical operations to solve the equation and once the solution base case is reached the equation is solved.
  

## Some Implementation Thought Which Is Not implemented

* For the classification of equations the most efficient way of going about it is to use machine learning algorithms, to classify the equations and be able to pass the for operation.
